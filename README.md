Nextron is a powerful Minecraft plugin which is meant to replace any other plugins you use at the moment. It has beautiful GUI's that simplifies the process to many users because you don't have to use complicated commands.

- A permission plugin is highly recommended, for example [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/), as it can manage all permissions.
- Nextron runs on Bukkit, Spigot, Paper and [Purpur (recommended)](https://purpurmc.org/).
- Nextron supports 1.13 and higher.
